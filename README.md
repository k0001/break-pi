Code by Renzo Carbonara for Alex Chadwick's **Baking Pi: Operating
Systems Development!** Course:

http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/freshers/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/

See the `LICENSE` file in this folder for licensing terms.

I'm including binaries with each commit for convenience.

Trivia: I misread the name of the course as *Breaking* Pi, and that's
why this repository is named `break-pi`.
